# Dev container

This `.devcontainer` directory contains the configuration for a [dev container](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers). It lets you open the repository in a [GitHub codespace](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/overview).

The dev container is configured to have the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview), so you can run `azd` commands directly.
